# Mango Engine
a not so simple sub 600 lines python script that powers the mango robot  

altought we didnt win, me, myself has learnt a lot from building this  
I can confiedently say that the issue was the aliance matching system not us  
I also decided to restructure the whole automatic code in the morning of the competetion causing issue with untested code  
there's gonna be a branch for our code out for the skill test (as far as I know its MakeX Thailand Exclusive)  

and a fully custom python intelsense for
- MakeBlock NovaPi
- NovaPi Power Expander Board
- MakeBlock Bluetooth Gamepad
- mBuild Sensors (Smart Camera, Ranging, Button, LED Matrix)
- Encoder Motor

PYTHON GO BRRR
